# ð“†¤DBay SQL Lexer

The DBay SQL Lexer takes an SQL string as input and returns a list of tokens in the format `[ type, text, line_nr, offset, ]`

# Acknowledgements

The DBay SQL Lexer is a fork of [mistic100/sql-parser](https://github.com/mistic100/sql-parser), with much
of the original code that was outside the scope of a lexer removed.


# To Do

* **[â€“]** return list of objects instead of list of lists
* **[â€“]** use lower case for type names

<!-- ## Is Done

* **[+]** implement `DBay::do()` as a method that unifies all of `better-sqlite3`'s `Statement::run()`,
 -->
