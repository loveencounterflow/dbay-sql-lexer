# ð“†¤DBay SQL Lexer

The DBay SQL Lexer takes an SQL string as input and returns a list of tokens in the format `{ type, text, idx, }`

# Acknowledgements

The DBay SQL Lexer is a fork of [mistic100/sql-parser](https://github.com/mistic100/sql-parser), with much
of the original code that was outside the scope of a lexer removed.


# To Do

* **[â€“]** use lower case for type names

## Is Done

* **[+]** return list of objects instead of list of lists
